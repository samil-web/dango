We are building a Next.js/Typescript application 
This is weight loss application. Its wireframe is at @.excalidraw file
We will not be starting development with building user authentication 
But keep in mind:
- Architecture Preparation:
Structure your code with authentication in mind
Use a service layer pattern for data access
Keep user-specific logic isolated in dedicated modules
Use environment variables for configuration
- Data Management:
Design your data models with a userId field from the start, even if not used initially
Structure your API endpoints with authentication middleware slots in mind
Use placeholder user IDs (like "default" or "anonymous") for the initial version
